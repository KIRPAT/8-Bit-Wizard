# 8-Bit Wizard The Escape

This is a Unity game engine demo I have coded for my capstone project. I was into motion controllers and tried to make myself one. I have used an Arduino, then connected an accelerometer, and a joystick to it. The player controlls the movement with joysticks but the camera is controlled with the accelerometer. 

If you are looking for the real hero, that would be the Uduino library. It allows Unity game engine to register my Arduino as a legitimate controller.
